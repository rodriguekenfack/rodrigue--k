  I- Data Types in Java
       
         Data type defines the values that a variable can take . We have two categories of data type In java : Primitive data types and Non-primitive data types

                1-Primitive data types
        we have eight primitive data types: boolean, char, byte, short, int, long, float and double

               a- Byte
byte can hold whole number between -128 and 127. usually used to save memory .
default size of this data type: 1 byte.
default value: 0 
               b- Short 
It's greater than byte in terms of size and less than integer. Its range is -32,768 to 32767.
Default size of this data type: 2 byte
               c-Int
Used when short is not large enough to hold the number, it has a wider range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Default size: 4 byte ,default value: 0
               d- Long : Used when int is not large enough to hold the value, it has wider range than int data type, ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 . Size : 8bytes , default value : 0
               e- Double: Sufficient for holding 15 decimal digits. Size : 8 bytes
               f-Float : Sufficient for holding 6 to 7 decimal digits. Size : Size 4bytes
               g-Boolean:  holds either true of false.
               h- Char : holds characters. Size: 2bytes
           II- Variable in Java
      A variable is a name associated with a value that can be changed. For example when I write int i=10; here variable name is i which is associated with value 10. 
Value is optional because in java, you can declare the variable first and then later assign the value to it.
                   1-Types of Variable in Java 
There are three types of variables in java :Local variable, Static (class) variable, Instance variable.
                    a- Static variables:  also known as class variable because they are associated with the class and common for all the instances of class.
                    b- Instance Variable: Each instance(objects) of class has its own copy of instance variable. It have their own separate copy of instance variable. 
                    c-Local Variable : They are declared inside method of the class. Their scope is limited to the method which means that You can’t change their values and access them outside of the method.
  
                  III- Access Modifiers in Java
 Access modifiers in Java helps to restrict the scope of a class, constructor , variable , method or data member. There are four types of access modifiers available in java:

                   1-Default (No keyword required) : no access modifier is specified for a class 

                   2-Private : it means “only visible within the enclosing class”. The private access modifier is specified using the keyword private.

                   3-Protect access : It's specified using the keyword protected . The methods or data members declared as protected are accessible within same package or sub classes in different package. 

                   4-Public: are accessible from every where  in the program. There is no restriction on the scope of a public data members.
